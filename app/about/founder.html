		        						<p>Mr. Jagdish Lal Juneja started working at his very young age and was a leading milk vendor at his native Kalanaur, Haryana. His Bicycle was his companion and the most important source for his business since he used it to transport the milk from his farms and serving fresh milk across the neighbouring city of Charkhi Dadri. Due to his daily routine of more than 35 KMs journey, he faced mechanical problems many times but the bicycle mechanics where never able to give the perfect repair he wanted for a smooth cycle journey.</p>

<p>This gap of having a good cycle mechanic made him start his own cycle repair shop in charkhi dadri. His passion towards cycles made him never use any other mode of transport other than cycle. As the customers base grew and the next generation including Mr. Subhash Juneja, Mr. Sanjay Juneja & Mr. Sunil Juneja came in and shaped up the legacy by founding JJ Cycles, Our Own cycle brand, crafted at our manufacturing unit at the year 2009.</p>


<p>JJ Cycles then took a brand makeover, we chose the name Oxygen since Cycles too like the air we breathe is important for many of us. With almost decades past from the day the journey kick started for Our founder, today we are one of the leading Indian Cycle Manufacturer with wide ranges of Bicycles manufactured with precision to excel. </p>
